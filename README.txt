VBA_Challenge-Stock Data Analysis Project

Project:
The goal of this project is to analyse stock market data of the year 2018, 2019, 2020. As the file was too large for script to run quickly, hence, another file with data was provided to develop code and test on it. The script will loop through all the stocks and output information, such as yearly change and total stock volume, of each stock. The code additionally returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest Total Volume" in summary table.

Steps for Solution:

-Solution 1 Ticker Symbol

The script will sort the distinct ticker symbol in one column in column "I" with a column header "Ticker.

-Solution 2 Total stock Volume

The total stock volume also generated on "J" column.

-Solution 3 Yearly Change

The code executed will generate Yearly change by comparing the opening price and closing price and put the value on "K" column. 

-Solution 4 Precent Change

The next task was to get percentage change in stock. Hence code generate percent change and put the value on "L" column.

-Solution 5 Conditional formating on Yearly change

The code was added for a conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green (colorIndex=4) and negative change in red (colorIndex=3).


-Solution 6 Getting Summary table
The code generated solution to provide the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" with Ticker symbol.

-Solution 7 Loop through other Years
The script loops through other years stock data and the same information is displayed for analysis.
